# Welcome to FRCDesign.org
FRCDesign.org is a comprehensive learning guide and technical reference for FRC design using Onshape.

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   :material-book-open-variant:{ .lg .middle } __The Design Guide__

    ---

    A guided curriculum through learning Onshape applied to robot design fundamentals. Looking to learn FRC robot design and CAD skills? Start here.

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Design Guide](design-guide/index.md)

-   :material-bookshelf:{ .lg .middle } __Design Fundamentals__

    ---

    Dives into the concepts necessary in order to design a competitive robot. Unlike the design guide, this is primarily a reference wiki. 

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Design Fundamentals](design-fundamentals/index.md)

-   :material-book:{ .lg .middle } __Mechanism Examples__

    ---

    Unlike other mechanism example collections, these are hand picked for specific concepts, with detailed breakdowns behind the design.

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Mechanism Examples](mechanism-examples/index.md)

-   :material-trophy:{ .lg .middle } __Design Challenges__

    ---

    We run weekly design challenges! (Think of them as mini Cadathons.) Try them here.

## What is FRCDesign.org?

1. FRCDesign.org is not just a resource collection. Though it includes many resources, almost all of the website's content has been written specifically for the website to align with our goals.
2. Everything is taught from a competitive focus. Designing competitive robots helps inspire students and teach both engineering skills and life skills. It's also generally more fun when the robot performs well instead of breaking.
2. We don't try to teach everything. The design guide is built around teaching a single CAD software (Onshape), and we encourage a specific design style which is optimized for the majority of mid-resource teams. 
3. We try to include the small details that most guides forget. The concept of an "arm" is almost ubiquitous, but the concepts behind designing a pivot that works every match and never breaks? That's not so much common knowledge and much more important.
4. Design practices are important! We try to document and teach [the best practices possible]() so you can design faster during the season.
