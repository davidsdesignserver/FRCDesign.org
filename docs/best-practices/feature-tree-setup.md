# Feature Tree Best Practices

In general, every part studio feature tree should start with a derive command, pulling down the relevant mastersketch. This is what you will build on. 

When modeling within the part studio, just remember to avoid duplicating parts and deriving COTS parts, as stated above. Duplicating parts, using many derive commands or overusing heavy featurescripts, such as the tube converter, can make your part studio loading times extremely high.

Sorting and naming your features can be a good idea, especially to make your CAD more understandable for someone who wasn't there when you did it.

On that note, naming your parts according to a convention is extremely beneficial down the line.
