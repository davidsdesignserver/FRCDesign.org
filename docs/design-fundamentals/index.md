# Design Fundamentals
This category includes fundamentals about engineering design in FRC, deep dives into various common mechanisms, and write-ups on other various design topics. This content is separate from CAD and is meant to be applicable no matter the software used. 

Keep in mind that this category is a large work in progress, and will continue to be added to long after the design guide is finished. Feel free to write your own content for something we don't have yet and we'll try to incorporate it into the website (follow the [contribution guide](../contribution/methodsOfContributing.md).)

## Structure
This section is all about robustness and designing with fabrication in mind. This means materials, types of structure, hardware, tolerances, tools and machines, etc.

(WIP) [**Materials**](structure/materials.md): Different types of common materials in FRC and how to use them best, as well as a guide on lightening.

(Not Started) [**Structure**](structure/structure.md): How to use materials in different forms and various COTS pieces to create a robust and versatile structure system.

(WIP) [**Hardware**](structure/hardware.md): A guide on hardware and hardware standards common in FRC, including best use cases and what to keep in mind when designing a robot in relation to hardware.


## Power Transmission
This section is all about the transmission of power to enable different kinds of actions, whether that's a pivot that needs only two positions or a whole range, spinning things to bring a game piece in, or deploying a mechanism

(Not Started) [**Electronics, Motors, and Sensors**](power-transmission/electronics-motors-sensors.md): A guide on how to design space for electronics, the differences between commonly used motors in FRC, and sensors that can be used to increase the controllability of a robot.

(Not Started) [**Pneumatics**](power-transmission/pneumatics.md): An overview of how pneumatic systems work, the components required for one, and potential tradeoffs and use cases for pneumatics on a robot.

(WIP) [**Transfer of Rotational Motion**](power-transmission/rotation.md): The basics of mechanical advantage, the transfer of torque and speed, and the differences and use for gears, belts, and chain.

(Not Started) [**Motion Components**](power-transmission/motion-components.md): A rundown of bearings, bushings, axles, and the best use cases for them, including the mechanics behind transmission of torque through axles.

(Not Started) [**Wheels and Rollers**](power-transmission/wheels-rollers.md): Various wheels sold, their mechanical properties, and various use cases for them. Also a guide to different rollers. Useful for manipulation of a game piece.

(Not Started) [**Linear Extension**](power-transmission/linear-extension.md): Covers various linear extension systems such as worm gears and rack and pinion.


## Mechanisms

[**Drivetrain**](mechanisms/drivetrain.md): A guide on drivetrains, drivebase rigidity, wheelbase location, and electrical mounting.

(Not Started) [**Elevators**](mechanisms/elevators.md): A guide on elevators, including different types of rigging, COTS parts, gearboxes, and use cases.

**More mechanisms coming eventually**

## Design Write-ups
Write-ups on important topics for FRC design that aren't necessarily fundamentals but can take your design a step further.

(Not Started) [**Designing for Controllability**](design-writeups/DFC.md): This page is about making your mechanisms and power transmission as easy to control as possible, including various ways to reduce backlash in systems.

(Not Started) [**Chain Tensioning Solutions**](design-writeups/chainTensioning.md): A number of different innovative ways to tension a chain to reduce backlash in a mechanism in a compact way.

(Not Started) [**Bumper Mounting Solutions**](design-writeups/bumperMounting.md): An overview of different bumper mounting solutions implemented by different teams or sold by different companies.

(Not Started) [**Springs and Shocks**](design-writeups/springs-shocks.md): Different forms of tension that can be used to lessen the load on structure or motors and how to use them.

(Not Started) [**Linkages**](design-writeups/linkages.md): An overview of mechanical linkages and different use cases for them in robots.
