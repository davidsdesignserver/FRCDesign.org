# Hardware Standards

A guide on hardware and hardware standards common in FRC, including best use cases and what to keep in mind when designing a robot in relation to hardware.

Modern FRC generally uses two different types of imperial hardware, #10-32 and 1/4-20. However, 10-32 is vastely preferrable, and with a bit of effort, we can make robots that use almost exclusively 10-32 hardware. In general:

- 10-32 is used for almost everything: retaining shafts, screwing into motors, superstructure, etc.
- 1/4-20 hardware is used for structural applications where more strength is required than #10 can provide. 

When designing around hardware, it is best to use the **hole tool**

- 10-32 hardware uses a hole diameter of **0.196 inches** for a standard fit
- 1/4-20 hardware uses a hole diameter of **0.257 inches** for a standard fit
