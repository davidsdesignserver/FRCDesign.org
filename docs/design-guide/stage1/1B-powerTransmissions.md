# 1B: Power Transmissions

## Introduction

So far the models you have created are all structural components, but this is only half of what makes up a robot. In order to make our robots move and score, motors that generate rotational motion are typically utilized. In Stage 1B, you'll be introduced to modeling basic *power transmissions*. Power transmissions include the motors, bearings, shafts, gears, belts, and chains that are used to transform rotational motion from a motor to do just about anything. 

In this stage, you'll focus on the fundamentals of power transmissions, with an emphasis on how to model them in CAD. The process of selecting motors and calculating power transmission ratios is gone over in detail in [the design fundamentals page about electronics, motors, and sensors](../../design-fundamentals/power-transmission/electronics-motors-sensors.md/) and also explored later in Stage 2 of the guide with multiple different mechanisms.

Below are some examples of power transmissions found in robots to achieve a range of different tasks.

In this stage, there are exercises designed to practice modeling simple power transmissions in the form of stand alone gearboxes. In stage 2, you will begin to model more integrated power transmissions within mechanisms. Practice exercise solutions can be found [here](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/c6a8ec29479a2578841fb9f2/w/85094b3baa15a05c873920c9/e/21fa04df80572c41ab64f27b).

## Motors

Motors spin! They transform electrical energy supplied by the robot battery into rotational motion. From intaking to climbing to driving, just about anything on your robot can be moved with the right motor(s).

<center><img src="\img\design-guide\stage1b\motorLineup.png" style="width:100%"></center>
<center>*Some of the motors available for use in FRC.*</center>

In FRC, a number of different motor options are available, all with different advantages and use cases. The most common type of motor found in modern FRC is the "CIM class" motor. This includes the CIM, Mini-CIM, Vexpro Falcon 500, WCP Kraken x60, Rev NEO, and Rev Vortex. While each of the CIM class motors have different speeds and power, they have two traits in common for modeling:

* The motors' outer diameters can be represented with a 2.5" diameter circle (some are slightly smaller at 60mm/2.362").
* The motors have anywhere from 2 to 11 holes for mounting, but all are on a 2" diameter bolt circle (See below image). The holes are #10-32 threaded (0.159"), as #10-32 is the hardware standard for COTS parts.

<center><img src="\img\design-guide\stage1b\cimBoltCircle.webp" style="width:50%"></center>
<figcaption>Mounting holes for CIM class motors are on a 2" diameter bolt circle. All of the holes are 1" away from the center of the motor.</figcaption>

All of the exercises for this stage will use CIM class motors. 

## Shafts and Bearings

Shafts transmit rotational power along an axis, with hex shafts being the most common in FRC. These hexagonal shafts, typically in 1/2" and 3/8" diameters (measured from flat to flat), may sometimes have rounded corners, known as "rounded hex" or "Thunderhex."

Bearings allow shafts to spin independently of plates and/or things to spin independently of shafts. Standard hex shafts use 1/2" hex bearings, while rounded hex shafts can use round bearings for easier assembly.

!!! Tip
    The easiest way to model shafts is to use the `Shaft` [Featurescript](/resources/featurescripts/). For bearings, insert your desired bearing from the MKCad app.

<center><img src="\img\design-guide\stage1b\bearingAndShaft.webp" style="width:75%"></center>
<center>*A rounded 1/2" hex bearing (Left) and 1/2" rounded hex shaft (Right). (Image Source: WCP)*</center>

## Torque and Speed

When designing power transmissions, there are two interlinked quantities that we are trying to modify: torque and speed. Torque refers to the rotational force applied to an object, while speed denotes how quickly that object rotates. In FRC, the unit used for speed is typically Rotations Per Minute (RPM). The units used for torque is typically Newton-Meters (Nm).

!!! Note
    Speed and torque are inversely related in mechanical systems. This means that as one increases, the other decreases, and vice versa. For example, if speed is decreased by 4x, torque is increased by 4x. This is because of the principle of conservation of energy: the output energy is the same as the input energy (ignoring losses like friction), so if speed is reduced through mechanical means, torque must increase.

### Mechanical Advantage

Many mechanical systems use the principle of the conservation of energy to convert energy from type to another, usually to produce larger forces or larger speeds with a set amount of force and speed at the beginning. ***Mechanical advantage*** is the ratio of output force to input force in a system, whether it's a lever, screw, gears, or pulley, mechanical advantage is used to quantify how the force changes.

The ratio between the number of teeth of the input and output gear/sprocket/pulley system represents the mechanical advantage of that system. This is also called the **gear ratio**, and is the key to understanding how to achieve a needed torque or speed from the set torque and speed of a given motor.

Gear ratio is typically written in the form `n1:n2`. Since torque and speed are interlinked quantities, the ratio can be understood from the perspective of torque or speed. From the perspective of torque, `n1` is the output torque for `n2` input torque. From the perspective of speed, `n1` is the speed of the input for `n2` speed of the output. 

!!! Example
    A system has a gear ratio of 4:1. This means the output torque is 4x the input torque and that the output speed is 1/4 the input speed.

For a single stage transmission (only two transmission components), `n1` is the size of the driven component for `n2` size of the driving component.

### Ratio Applications

An arm mechanism needs very low RPM but a lot of torque to control efficiently, so a large *reduction* of speed might be used to increase torque. This depends on the weight and length of the arm, but can be 30:1 up to even 200:1. 

Shooter wheels or intake rollers often have little to no reduction, and in some cases may even need to go faster than the motor's free speed. In this case, an *upduction* can be be used to increase the speed, but the output torque gets lower as a consequence. Upductions typically don't get much higher than 1:2 due to the available motors already having a high speed, low torque output. A 1:2 upduction would double the speed and halve the torque of the input.

!!! Tip
    For situations that require higher speed and higher torque than what a single motor can provide, add more motors.




## Power Transmissions

In FRC, the three most common types of power transmissions are gears, chain and sprocket, and belt and pulley. Although they all achieve the same end result of changing speed and torque, they each excel in different situations. In the following sections you'll be introduced to each of them and how to model them.

!!! Note
    Gears, sprockets, and pulleys all follow profile standards that specify how big the teeth are. This means that the ratio between the number of teeth and diameter of the part is a constant. There are different profile standards, but only parts of the same profile can be meshed or used together.

### Gear Basics
Gears are mechanical devices with teeth that mesh with each other to transmit motion or power between rotating shafts. They're like wheels with teeth that fit together, allowing them to transfer torque, change speed, and change direction of rotation. 

<center><img src="\img\design-guide\stage1b\gears\simpleGears.gif" style="width:40%"></center>
<center>*A simple animation of two gears meshing. Notice that meshed gears will spin in opposite directions.*</center>

In order to change the torque and speed from the input to output, different sized gears must be used. Remember that the ratio is related to the number of teeth of the gears. Teeth will always mesh together one by one, but the number of teeth per revolution is different for different sized gears, causing a difference in angular speed even if the surface speed of the gear is the same.

**Center to Center Calculation** 

To calculate how far apart to space the gears, you can use the following formula to calculate the center-to-center distance:

<center>**`CC = 0.5*PD1 + 0.5*PD2`**</center>

Where `PD1` and `PD2` are the *Pitch Diameters* of the two gears. The **Pitch Diameter (PD)**  is the size of the imaginary circle that passes through the center of the gear teeth. The pitch diameters of two gears should be tangent in order for the gears to properly mesh. The equation for PD is as follows:

<center>**`PD = (# of teeth) / DP`**</center>

Where DP stands for **Diametrical Pitch**. For now, you can assume it to always be 20. If you're curious, you can learn more about this in the Design Fundamentals pages.

<center><img src="\img\design-guide\stage1b\gears\gearDiagram.webp" style="width:70%"></center>
<center>*Illustration of a gear's pitch diameter and outer diameter. (Image source: <a href="https://docs.wcproducts.com/frc-build-system/belts-chain-and-gears/gears">WCP</a>).*</center>

**Modeling Gear Transmissions**

When modeling, an easy way to set the center-to-center distance between two gears is to draw two circles sized to the gears' pitch diameters and then set two circles to be tangent to each other. For example, if you need to mesh a 20T gear and a 60T gear, you can draw a `20/20 = 1"` and a `60/20 = 3"` circle and add a tangent constraint between the two circles. The reason we enter the full expression is so that we can easily see what the circle represents (a gear, sprocket, or pulley, and how many teeth it has).

<center><img src="\img\design-guide\stage1b\gears\gearCad.webp" style="width:60%"></center>
<figcaption>Modeling gear C-C distance by constraining two pitch diameter construction circles tangent. The diameters of the circle are calculated by dividing the tooth count by DP, which is 20 in this case.</figcaption>

It's recommended to input the pitch diameter fraction (Eg: `(60/20)"`) rather than the calculated pitch diameter (Eg: Only inputting `3"` as the dimension) so that you can easily see the tooth count of the designed gear. 

#### Exercise 1: Simple Gearbox 

In this exercise, you will be CADing and assembling a simple single stage gearbox. Practice exercise solutions can be found [here](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/c6a8ec29479a2578841fb9f2/w/85094b3baa15a05c873920c9/e/21fa04df80572c41ab64f27b).

The goal of this exercise is to introduce how to model a very simple gear transmission. Additionally, you will learn how to use the the `Shaft` Featurescript, `Replicate` tool, MKCad parts library, and part configurations.

!!! Note
    Exercise 1 adds hardware (bolts and nuts) to the CAD models. You can read more about hardware standards on the [Design Fundamentals](/design-fundamentals/) page.

!!! Tip
    To lock mate inferences when you see the one you want to select, hold the `Shift` key when mousing. This is particularly useful for mating the motor pinion gear.

In this exercise you made your first gearbox. In doing so, you also used part configurations - a powerful tool that allows for variations of the same part. The gears that you inserted from MKCad were configurable - you were able to easily change the tooth count of the gear without needing to inserting a new component.

#### Exercise 2: Two Stage Gearbox

In this exercise, you will be CADing and assembling a two stage gearbox. Practice exercise solutions can be found [here](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/c6a8ec29479a2578841fb9f2/w/85094b3baa15a05c873920c9/e/21fa04df80572c41ab64f27b).

The goal of this exercise is to practice modeling more advanced gearboxes. You will also learn how to use the `Vent` Featurescript used for pocketing.

### Belts and Pulley Basics

Timing belt and pulley drives are mechanical systems used to transmit motion and power between rotating shafts using flexible belts and pulleys. The system consists of two main components: the belt, which is a flexible loop made of a material like rubber, and the pulleys, which are wheels with grooves that the belt wraps around. As one pulley rotates, it drives the belt, which in turn drives the other pulley, transferring motion and power from one shaft to another


<center><img src="\img\design-guide\stage1b\belt\beltAndPulley.webp" style="width:50%"></center>
<center>*A belt and pulley transmission. (Image Source: [ReCalc](https://www.reca.lc/belts))*</center>

In order to change the torque and speed from the input to the output, different sized pulleys must be used. The mechanical advantage for belt transmissions, similar to gears, is based on the ratio between the number of teeth of the output pulley to the number of teeth of the input pulley. Note that unlike gears, pulleys will spin in the same direction.

**Types of Belt**

Like gears, belts also have a pitch. The pitch is defined as the distance between each tooth on the belt. In FRC, this is typically 5 mm. To calculate the pitch diameter of a pulley, the following equation can be used:

<center>**`PD = Pitch * (# of Teeth) / 3.14`**</center>

Belts also come in various widths. In FRC, you will typically use either 9 mm or 15 mm wide belts.

**Center to Center Calculation**

To calculate the center-to-center distance of the pulleys, it is recommended to use an online calculator, such as [ReCalc](https://www.reca.lc/belts). In the calculator, you can set the belt pitch, desired center distance, and the number of teeth on each pulley to get the closest integer belt size  (belt tooth counts must be whole numbers) and corresponding center to center distance.

**Modeling Belt Transmissions**

When modeling, you will typically draw either the pitch diameter of the two pulleys and connect them with tangent lines to represent the belt. A simplified 3D model of the belt can be generated using the `Contextless Belts` Featurescript from [Julia's Featurescripts](/resources/featurescripts/#julias-featurescripts).

### Chain and Sprocket Basics

Roller chain and sprocket drives are very similar to belt and pulley transmissions. They consist of two main components: a chain, which is a series of interconnected links, and sprockets, which are toothed wheels that mesh with the chain. As the sprockets rotate, they engage with the chain, causing it to move and transmit power from one shaft to another. Bikes are an everyday object that use chain to transmit power. Chains excel at transmitting high force over long distances.

<center><img src="\img\design-guide\stage1b\chain\chainAnimation.gif" style="width:40%"></center>
<center>*A simple animation of chain and sprocket. Notice that the sprockets will spin in the same direction.*</center>

In order to change the torque and speed from the input to the output, different sized sprockets must be used. The mechanical advantage for chain transmissions, similar to gears and pulleys, is based on the ratio between the number of teeth of the output sprocket to the number of teeth of the input sprocket. Similar to pulleys, the sprockets will spin in the same direction.

**Types of Chain**

The two commonly used sizes of roller chain in FRC is #25 and #35 chain, with 0.25" and 0.375" pitch respectively. For chain, the **pitch** is the length of each link. To calculate the pitch diameter, the following equation can be used:

<center>**`PD = Pitch * (# of Teeth) / 3.14`**</center>

Additionally, the **chain clearance diameter** describes the diameter of the sprocket with the chain wrapped around it. The following equation can be used:

<center>**`Clearance Diameter = PD + Pitch`**</center>

Below is an illustration of the pitch, pitch diameter, outside diameter, and chain clearance diameter of a sprocket.

<center><img src="\img\design-guide\stage1b\chain\chainDiagram.webp" style="width:70%"></center>
<center>*Illustration of chain sprocket diameter measures. (Image source: <a href="https://docs.wcproducts.com/frc-build-system/belts-chain-and-gears/sprockets-and-chain">WCP</a>)*</center>

In FRC, #25 chain is most commonly used as it is strong yet relatively lightweight. #35 is sometimes used on very high torque transmissions, but it is heavy and bulky. 

**Center to Center Calculation** 

Calculating sprocket center-to-center is very similar to pulley center-to-centers. To calculate the center-to-center distance of the sprockets, it is recommended to use an online calculator, such as [ReCalc](https://www.reca.lc/chains). In the calculator, you can set the chain size, desired center distance, and the number of teeth on each sprocket to get the required center distance.

When modeling, you will typically draw either the pitch diameter or chain clearance diameter of the two sprockets and connect them with tangent lines to represent the links. A simplified 3D model of the chain can be generated using the `Chain Generator` Featurescript from [Julia's Featurescripts](/resources/featurescripts/#julias-featurescripts). The modeling workflow is very similar to belt and pulley.

**Chain Tensioners**

One difficulty when designing with chain is that it will physically stretch as it is used. This means the distance between each link will slightly increase, making the overall chain longer in a non-insignificant way. Loose chain can be difficult to fix if the chain transmission is not designed with chain tensioning in mind. Although you will not be learning about chain tensioning methods quite yet, you should keep this idea in the back of your mind. In Stage 2, different chain tensioning methods are introduced in the context of different types of robot mechanisms. The [Design Fundamentals page](/design-fundamentals/) also dives deeper into this topic.

<center><img src="\img\design-guide\stage1b\chain\turnbuckle.webp" style="width:60%"></center>

#### Exercise 3: Belt and Gear Transmission

In this exercise, you will be modeling a two stage gearbox that uses gears and belts. This gearbox will also include elements like frame and gussets, which you previously learned in Stage 1A. Practice exercise solutions can be found [here](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/c6a8ec29479a2578841fb9f2/w/85094b3baa15a05c873920c9/e/21fa04df80572c41ab64f27b).

The goal of this exercise is to continue to ramp up your modeling skills. Always make sure to fully define your sketches and keep your feature and instance trees organized.

In this exercise, you modeled a fairly complex gearbox that was integrated with some frame elements. At this point, you should be begin to feel comfortable with the sketching and extrude tools. You should also familiarize yourself with all the options present in the Featurescripts that you have used up until this point by playing around with different settings. 

To get a feel for how parametric your model is, you can try and change certain key dimensions in the layout sketches, such as the length of the tubes, angle of the tubes, length of the belt, and the size of the gears. Play around with which modifications will update smoothly and which require additional fixes in the CAD.

You may also be curious as to how things like the hole sizes, materials, etc were selected in each of these designs. You are encouraged to learn more by browsing the [Design Fundamentals](/design-fundamentals/) pages which contain in-depth information on a wide range of topics, or by discussing with your team and or other students and mentors on the DDS Discord.

## Summary

Congratulations on completing Stage 1B! Keep up the good work! Remember that practice is key - the only way to get better is to model more.

Here is a quick summary of what you have achieved in stage 1B:

* Learned about speed, torque, and mechanical advantage
* Learned the basics of motors, bearings, shafts, gears, chain and sprockets, and belt and pulleys
* Learned how to model basic power transmissions
* Learned how to use the `Contextless Belt`, `Chain Generator`, `Shaft`, and `Vent` Featurescripts
* Learned how to insert Standard Library components and mate bolts and nuts
* Learned how to use the `Replicate` tool

Again, it should be noted that Stage 1B is a very basic introduction to modeling power transmissions and some details were glossed over. Stage 2 will introduce how to *design* power transmissions - selecting motors and calculating optimal ratios. For future reference, you can refer to the [Design Fundamentals](/design-fundamentals/) power transmissions pages, which are more in depth.

In stage 1C, you will begin to learn the basic workflow for robot modeling. This is the final step before being able to design a full mechanism!
