# 1A: Onshape Fundamentals

Welcome to Stage 1! Here, you'll engage in a series of Onshape exercises and projects designed to introduce and develop your CAD skills within an FRC context. 

## Getting Started
In 1A, there are 3 major sections: sketching and part design, multi-part part studios, and assemblies. Each section has a link to a learning course to learn the skills of each topic, then an exercise to help immediately apply those skills in an FRC context. 

### Learning Courses
[Onshape's Learning Center](https://learn.onshape.com/) provides free learning courses and articles covering everything from document navigation and sketching to advanced surface and sheet metal modeling. It's a valuable resource for both novice and seasoned users alike. We use a few selected courses to assist learning the fundamentals of doing CAD in Onshape, but the rest of the curriculum is project based.

The structure of the courses includes some short videos and practice models, expected time is 2-4 hours.

!!! Tip
    Additionally, the [Onshape Help](https://cad.onshape.com/help/Content/EnterpriseHelp/Content/home.htm?tocpath=Welcome%20to%20Onshape%20Help%7C_____0) site is a great resource to use if you are unsure how a specific feature of Onshape works. 

!!! Warning
    The Onshape learning courses are important as they will teach you the Onshape interface and form a basic foundation for CAD skills. Unless you have prior experience using Onshape, you should not skip the learning courses as the exercises assume that you have an understanding of CAD basics.

### Practice Exercises
Make a copy of the [Stage 1A Exercises Document](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/812b2974ed32b9c89e8f1e25/w/747e47444b6c685bd0bee334/e/58894354f0152cd6485fe45e?renderMode=0&uiState=663d81b7afce5246f0309e28). A template for each exercise has been created for you in the exercises document (you do not need to create any new tabs). Each exercise also includes a preview of what the final model should look like in the `Reference` file. Solutions are available [here](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/1bdaed8e23446ffe70a851a4/w/37cd1a4984497b01d74e4c41/e/fd6796321fb9611305e5ff7d?renderMode=0&uiState=663d81d5d060d67d3cd48855).

!!! Tip
    You can navigate between the tabs by accessing the tab manager or from the bottom navigation bar. 
    <center><img src="\img\design-guide\stage1a\1a-tabs.gif" width="100%"> </center>
    <center> *Accessing the Tab Manager.* </center>

    
## Sketching and Part Design
Sketches and features are the building blocks you will use to create every 3D model in Onshape, so it's good to have a good grasp on the fundamentals.

Complete the following courses:

1. The [**Introduction to Sketching**](https://learn.onshape.com/courses/introduction-to-sketching) course runs you through different sketch tools, constraints, and a good sketch workflow.

2. The [**Part Design Using Part Studios**](https://learn.onshape.com/courses/fundamentals-part-design-using-part-studios) course runs you through creating different parts with a variety of features.

With a good understanding of both of these, you can create almost any part you want to. The following sections are all about integrating design intent into the process and learning how to design a whole project with multiple pieces.

!!! Tip
    For future reference without having to go through the learning center, [sketch basics](https://cad.onshape.com/help/Content/sketch_basics.htm?tocpath=Part%20Studios%7C_____15), [sketch tools](https://cad.onshape.com/help/Content/sketch-tools.htm?TocPath=Part%20Studios%7CSketch%20Tools%7C_____0), [feature basics](https://cad.onshape.com/help/Content/feature-basics.htm?tocpath=Part%20Studios%7C_____17), and [feature tools](https://cad.onshape.com/help/Content/featuretools.htm?TocPath=Part%20Studios%7CFeature%20Tools%7C_____0) are all covered in text form in the help center. 

### Exercise 1: Simple Box Tube
In FRC, robot structures are typically constructed out of aluminum box tubing, similar to wood beams for a house. Aluminum box tubing is commonly found in 2"x1", 1"x1", and 2"x2" sizes with 1/8" (thickwall) or 1/16" (thinwall) wall thicknesses. Box tubing is typically referred to by its size, eg: 2x1, 1x1, and 2x2 (Spoken as "two-by-one", "one-by-one", and "two-by-two"). For the rest of the design-guide, we will use this notation when referring to box tube.


!!! Example
    <center><img src="\img\design-guide\stage1a\tube.webp" width="45%"> </center>
    <center> *Example of 2x1 box tube structure on a robot* </center>

For exercise 1, you will be modeling a simple 2x1 with some holes in it. For this exercise, do not use any Featurescripts.

!!! Note
    You will see in some slides that the sketch dialogue box has a different name, such as "Tube Profile". You can rename sketches and features by hovering over the name in the dialogue box and clicking the pencil icon, or right clicking a sketch or feature in the feature list and clicking "rename". 
    
    You should name your sketches and features and organize them into folders. This helps enable collaboration and makes working on previous features much faster.

</div>

Notice how we utilized construction geometry to define the location of the holes on the 2" face of the tube. Using construction geometry to assist with sketching makes your parts more parametric and betters conveys design intent compared to manually specifying the location of each hole with dimensions.



## Multi-Part Modeling

Complete the [Multi-Part Part Studios](https://learn.onshape.com/courses/fundamentals-multi-part-part-studios) course. It runs you through top-down design principles (EXTREMELY important in FRC), sketching for multiple parts (master sketches), and some more practical skills for working with multiple parts in a part studio.

As introduced in the learning course, Onshape is a software focused on multi-body modeling and top-down design. In FRC, this usually means one master sketch and one part studio per subsystem. Check out [this page](../../best-practices/sub-document-setup.md) to learn more about best practices for sub-documents. The following practice exercises will help you reinforce these concepts.

!!! Example
    Notice how there's one instance of each unique part within this part studio. The part studio also resembles the completed product, as the parts are modeled relative to each other.
    <center><img src="\img\design-guide\stage1a\1a-PartStudio.webp" width="55%"></center>
    <center> *Example of a part studio* </center>


### Exercise 2: Box Tube and Gusset Joint
For this exercise, you will design two tubes and a part called a "gusset". A gusset is the flat part that connects the two tubes. This gusset will be created in the same part studio as the tubes that it is connecting!

!!! Example
    <center><img src="\img\design-guide\stage1a\8033-000-2024C_8.png" width="45%"> </center>
    <center> *Example of a gusset* </center>

You will utilize the `Extrude Individual` and `Tube Converter` Featurescripts for this exercise. Do not use the `Gusset` Featurescript for this exercise.

The `Extrude individual` Featurescript enables you to extrude sketch regions without merging them. In this exercise, if you were to extrude the sketch of the tubes with the standard <code>Extrude</code> tool, only a single part would generate.

The `Tube Converter` Featurescript condenses the steps of shelling, sketching and dimensioning holes, and extruding holes into a single, customizable feature to easily model tubes. 

!!! Tip
    When extruding a sketch in a part studio, you can decide whether to `Add` to existing geometry, or to create `New` geometry. `New` creates a new body, whereas `Add` will merge the feature with existing parts. Make sure that when you extrude your gusset, you tell Onshape to create a new part.

  <!-- The dots/circles -->

    <!-- Dots will be generated here -->
  </div>
</div>

In this exercise, you can begin see the power of Featurescripts. What would have been a number of sketches, extrudes, and shells to create the tubes is packaged into a single, easy to use custom feature. 

## Assemblies

Assembling is the basic function of defining the position and motion of parts in an assembly.

The [Onshape Assemblies](https://learn.onshape.com/courses/fundamentals-onshape-assemblies) course introduces assemblies, mating parts together, and other useful assembly concepts.

As was introduced in the Onshape learning tutorials, when parts are inserted into an assembly, they free float. We can utilize a number of different assembly tools to constrain the motion of all the parts:

- **`Group`**: Restricts the relative motion between a group of parts
- **`Fix`**: Locks a part in place within the assembly (not recommended as it's not parametric)
- **`Mates`**: Tools to constrain the degrees of freedom between parts using "mate connectors." These connectors are automatically generated or manually created coordinate systems on parts. You can align the axes and apply offsets in any direction or rotation. Different mates constrain different degrees of freedom. Here are three commonly used mates:
    - `Fasten`: Prevents any movement between two mate connectors, such as a bolt in a hole
    - `Revolute`: Allows rotational movement about the z-axis between two mate connectors (e.g. an arm pivot)
    - `Slider`: Enables linear movement along the z-axis between two mate connectors (e.g. an elevator)

!!! Example
    <center><img src="\img\design-guide\stage1a\1a-fasten.gif"width="90%"></center>
    <center> *Example of a fasten mate.* </center>

The best practices for constraining an assembly, along with other assembly tools like replicate, pattern, and standard content, will be learned through projects and described in more detail in later stages. They are also outlined in the [assembly best practices](../../best-practices/assembly-setup.md) page.


### Exercise 3: Box Tube Frame
For this exercise, you will create a simple frame and two gussets. Then, you will create an assembly and mate together all the components.

You will utilize the `Extrude Individual`, `Tube Converter`, and `Gusset` Featurescripts for this exercise.

The `Gusset` Featurescript is an easy way to create gussets by selecting the locations of the holes the gusset should attach to.

</div>

In this exercise, you were introduced to yet another highly useful Featurescript for creating gussets. Additionally, notice that we only model 1 of each type of gusset in the part studio. For the tubes, we choose to model all of the tubes even though the two vertical tubes are the same - this is to make assembly more parametric since the tube would otherwise be difficult to mate.

It should be noted that while fixing the tube is not considered an [assembly best practice](/best-practices/assembly-setup#origin-cube-method) for setting the origin of an assembly, it is sufficient for the purposes of these exercises.

### Exercise 4: Climber Hook

As you get more comfortable with modeling, we can begin to draw more complex parts. For this exercise, you will create a climber hook and tube. Then, you will create the assembly and mate together the components.

You will utilize the `Spacer` Featurescript for this exercise.

In this exercise, you practiced more advanced sketching and were introduced to the `Spacer` Featurescript. 

## Summary

Congratulations on completing Stage 1A! Remember, practice is essential – the more CAD models you create, the more proficient and efficient you'll become. Using keyboard shortcuts can significantly accelerate your CAD workflow. Be attentive to best practices to avoid developing any bad habits. Keep up the good work!

Here is a quick summary of what you have achieved in 1A:

* Learned how to use the OnShape interface and basic sketching and modeling features with the OnShape Learning Center courses
* Learned how to model basic FRC structures
* Learned how to use the `Gusset`, `Extrude Individual`, `Tube Converter`, and `Spacer` Featurescripts
* Learned how to assemble basic models using `Group` and `Fasten`
* Learned how to insert models into assemblies using the MKCad parts library

In stage 1B, you will be introduced to power transmissions, which enable your robot to move and score.
