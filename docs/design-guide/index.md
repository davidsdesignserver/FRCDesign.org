# FRC Design Guide and Curriculum

Welcome to the DDS design guide! This guide is in progress, so if you have difficulty understanding something, please give us feedback as soon as possible!

This design guide assumes you know about FRC and have gone through at least a season of FRC. As this guide develops, we hope to cover absolute beginners, but for now this helps keep the project a bit more feasible. We'll cover getting Onshape set up and all the various tools you need at first, then start working immediately on projects which help build your CAD skills while gradually introducing design principles.

Although heavily recommended to go through for now, the aim is to replace the [Onshape Learning Center](https://learn.onshape.com/), at least in the context of FRC. Eventually, you will be able to just go through this guide to become both proficient at using Onshape and at designing good robots for FRC.

Instead of covering random features and tools that you might not use in FRC, this curriculum focuses on using features and skills that would be beneficial to use in an FRC context. After the fundamentals for sketching and part design are learned, it focuses very heavily on guided projects, slowly becoming more open-ended.

## Beginner Stages

!!! Tip
    If you already have some experience with CAD in Onshape, specifically sketching and part design, you may skip to [Stage 1B](stage1/1B-powerTransmissions.md) for your first project and continue from there. It will help you start learning the preferred workflow to design mechanisms in Onshape.

### [Stage 0](stage0/0A-introductionToCAD.md)

Stage 0 is for people that haven't touched CAD or Onshape before. It includes an in-depth introduction to CAD to read or skim through, a walkthrough to setup your Onshape account and add the tools you need to continue with the curriculum, a guide on navigating Onshape and the difference between part studios and assemblies, and some basic CAD theory that will help develop a good mindset. After this stage you can move onto the next one and actually start learning and practicing your skills. 

### [Stage 1](stage1/1A-onshapeFundamentals.md)

In this stage, you begin with learning the fundamentals of Onshape sketching and part design, then move onto guided projects (a swerve drivebase and two gearboxes) to teach you how to use tools, part studios, and assemblies in the context of FRC. We'll try to briefly cover a number of fundamental FRC-specific tools that will help speed up your workflow.


### [Stage 2](stage2/2A-drivebaseFullDetail.md)

In stage 2 we continue to focus on covering more design skills and concepts while we practice our CAD skills, but through isolated mechanisms. There will be fewer new CAD concepts introduced here, while we introduce 1-2 design concepts per project. By the end of this stage you should be significantly more comfortable using Onshape as well as have an understanding of the mechanisms that go into a robot and the workflow required to design those mechanisms. 


### [Stage 3](stage3/3A-multidoc&MS.md)

After finishing the last stage, you should be comfortable with the tools required to design a robot. This stage transitions to higher level projects, first focusing on high-level design practices and workflows, like how to create effective mastersketches, then transitions into replicating simple robots using what you've learned about both the CAD and the mechanisms themselves. You will learn how the basic mechanisms integrate together and how to apply top-down design practices.

## [Intermediate: Stage 4](stage4.md)

In this stage, you'll focus on mastering the design fundamentals to the point where they are natural. This means learning how to optimize your CAD to be more parametric, mastering best practices and workflow that makes your CAD faster and more easily collaborated on, and learning more about engineering design and strategic design.
