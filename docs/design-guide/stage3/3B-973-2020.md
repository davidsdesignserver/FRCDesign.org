# 3B: Replicating 973's 2020 Robot

In this stage, we focus on integration and putting everything together into one cohesive project. We'll be designing two robots, a 973 2020 style shooter robot, and a 973 2023 pick and place robot. These hit many of the fundamentals necessary in order design a robot, and by the end you should be prepared for designing robots in the season with some practice in the intermediate stages.
