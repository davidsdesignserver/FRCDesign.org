# 2A: Full Detail Drivebase

Welcome to Stage 2! This section is focused the design of common mechanisms in FRC, both through CAD skills and best practices and through key engineering concepts. Each project's guide will delve into the reasoning behind specific design decisions and the criteria they fulfill, providing less step-by-step instruction and encouraging more independent CAD work.

## Introduction

The first project in Stage 2 will be detailing the drivetrain you began modeling in Stage 1B. So far, you’ve only modeled the frame and bare bellypan. To finish the drivetrain, you should add the following details.

1. Battery Mounting: Every robot needs a battery, and while the location may vary based on the other mechanisms present in your robot, it should always be placed as low as possible to make the robot more stable.

2. Electronics Mounting: Adequate space must be allocated on the robot for ease of wiring. Typically, the robot’s electronics are mounted on the bellypan.

3. Bellypan Pocketing: This step is optional. Some teams will prefer to add cutouts in their bellypan to remove weight and make wiring easier. However, pocketing the bellypan significantly increases machining time.

4. Bumpers: While bumper rules can vary from year to year, they are almost always required to protect your robot and other robots from collisions. Making your bumpers easy to attach and remove is also a very nice quality of life improvement for when you’re at competition.

While the exact implementation for each of these details will vary based on the rest of your robot and from team to team, an example reference for Stage 2A is provided [here](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/86303b75f6f9790b01106a3b/w/6d34296fadf33319c731fa02/e/245e154bf8681866056b6985).

## Battery Mounting
Ensuring that your robot’s battery does not fall out of your robot is critical for successful robot operation. While it may seem obvious, even veteran teams [sometimes](https://youtu.be/bhjb3Vw8YHg?si=Bxm7oD5VkmYW7oj0&t=105) get [this](https://youtu.be/Dr_rnN2bjno?si=roWawTsyWt5W3RdA&t=86) wrong. 
Successful battery mounting can be broken down into two components: good battery placement and a robust battery holder.

### Battery Placement
Batteries are heavy: the FRC robot battery weighs a whopping 13 lbs. Since the battery is so heavy, you need to place it as low as possible to keep your robot’s center of gravity low to prevent falling over. Most teams will typically use the bellypan to support their battery as this is the lowest location on the robot. 

### Battery Holder

A strong strap should also be used to secure the battery to the mounting and prevent the battery from flying out of the robot on hard collisions. A good option is to use a 1” or 2” wide buckle strap, which can be purchased and cut to size from most stores. FRC vendors like WCP also sell [battery mounting accessories](https://wcproducts.com/products/batteries-accessories) including battery holders and straps.

<center><img src="\img\design-guide\stage2a\batt\battStrap.webp" style="width:70%"></center>

Below we've provided one option for mounting the battery. In this design, the battery is placed horizontally on the bellypan. It is secured with a 2" wide strap that wraps around the battery and bellypan to secure it.

## Electronics Mounting

To make wiring the robot and later inspecting the wiring easier, enough space should be left around each electrical component. You should work with your electrical teammates to determine the best location for the various control system parts. Teams typically try to mount their electronics on the bellypan, permitted there is space. 

<center><img src="\img\design-guide\stage2a\elec\elecPic.png" style="width:80%"></center>
<center>*Layout of various different electronic components on a bellypan.*</center>

A list of typical electrical components found on FRC robots is provided below, as well as a recommended mounting location. Again, mounting locations are highly dependent on the rest of your robot, make sure to always coordinate with your electrical team to decide what is best.


| **Component** | **Function** | **Suggested Location** |
|---|---|---|
| Power Distribution Hub (PDH) or  Power Distribution Panel (PDP) | Required to distribute power | Bellypan |
| Main Breaker | Required to power on/off the robot | Somewhere easily accessible and close to the PDH and Battery |
| RoboRIO | Required to control the robot | Bellypan |
| Integrated motor controller (eg: Falcon 500, Kraken X60) | Powers and controls the  integrated motor | No electrical mounting required |
| Discrete motor controller  (eg: Spark Max, Talon SRX) | Required to power and control some motors  (eg: Neo, CIM) | Near the controlled motor  or on the bellypan |
| Robot Radio | Required for robot communications | Follow Vivid Hosting's [radio mounting guidelines](https://frc-radio.vivid-hosting.net/getting-started/usage/mounting-your-radio). |
| Robot Signal Light | Required to indicate robot status | Somewhere easily visible |
| Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) Sensor | Used to determine robot heading | Ontop of the RoboRIO |
| Voltage Regulator Modules | Can be used for custom circuits | Bellypan |
| Radio Power Module (RPM) | Powers the OpenMesh Radio | Not required for VH Radio |
| Pneumatics Hub | Controls pneumatic components | Bellypan |

!!! Warning
    It is a very common misconception that the robot’s IMU sensor (eg: CTRE Pigeon, NavX) must be mounted at the center of the robot. The IMU can be mounted anywhere on the robot, as long as it is securely mounted. An easy place to mount the IMU is right on top of the RoboRIO.

One option for mounting the Power Distribution Hub (PDH), main breaker, and RoboRIO onto the bellypan is provided in the below example. The `Electronic Mounting` Featurescript can be very useful for generating the mounting holes for electronics. If you cannot accurately manufacture mounting holes for electronics, VHB tape (which comes in the Kit of Parts) can be a good option for robustly securing your electronics.

It is recommended to use the Simplified electronics models to improve assembly performance. You can read more about simplified models on the [Assembly Best Practices Page](/best-practices/assembly-setup/). Simplified swerve module models can also be used to reduce lag. 

Every robot is also required to have a Robot Signal Light (RSL). An easy location to mount the RSL is on the side of the drive frame. Typically, only one RSL is required and needs to be “easily visible while standing 3 ft. (~ 100 cm) away from at least one side of the ROBOT”. Be sure to check the latest game manual rules for the most up to date RSL mounting rules.

<center>*RSL mount constructed out of 1/8" thick polycarbonate plate. The mounting hole for the RSL is 1” in diameter. The RSL model can be found in the MKCad App.*</center>

Each robot is also required to have a radio. The radio should be mounted on the robot following Vivid Hosting's [radio mounting guidelines](https://frc-radio.vivid-hosting.net/getting-started/usage/mounting-your-radio).

## Bellypan Pocketing

Some teams may choose to pocket their bellypan to reduce weight and make wiring easier. A pocketed bellypan can save around 3-4 lbs. However, this will add significant machining time if you are manufacturing the bellypan yourself or increase cost if you are purchasing the bellypan from a fabrication service (eg: [Fabworks](https://fabworks.com/)). You should carefully consider the tradeoffs with your team.

If you choose to pocket your bellypan, you can utilize the `Vent`, `Lighten`, or `Part Lighten` Featurescripts to pocket the bellypan. While the workflow may slightly vary between each Featurescript, the general idea is the same. A diamond pattern is recommended for strength and ease of modeling.

## Bumpers
Bumper construction is described in each year’s FRC game manual. Typically, it is required to be two 2.5” diameter pool noodles backed by a 5” tall 3/4" thick plywood sheet. Refer to the latest game manual for the most up to date bumper rules. Bumper cutout and ground clearance rules will vary from year to year.

### Bumper Model
To begin, you'll need to model the bumpers. It is recommended to place the bumpers in a new part studio and assembly to keep your feature and assembly trees organized. The minimum level of detail should be a block model of the bumper. Some teams may opt to model the bumper wood, bumper wood holes, angle brackets for the bumper wood, and other details to assist with manufacturing. You should communicate with the rest of your team members to determine the level of detail that is required.

</div>

Keeping the bumper part studio and assembly separate from the drivetrain keeps the drivetrain feature tree cleaner and allows for easier hiding/showing of the bumpers in the top level assembly since you can show and hide the entire bumper assembly at once.

### Bumper Mounting

Next, you'll need to model your desired bumper mounts in the drivetrain part studio. 

Similar to battery mounting, good bumper mounting is often overlooked. While a robust bumper mounting system won’t win you any matches, a poor bumper mounting system can certainly lose you a match. Poor bumper mounting can lead to bumper damage, long bumper swap time, or even lead to your [bumpers falling off](https://youtu.be/pBUKxWKGV-Q?si=hmJtt9N6C7vGLFpL&t=42).

In the provided example, the threaded stud bumper mounting system is implemented. You can learn more about bumpers and different bumper mounting options in the [Design Fundamentals](/design-fundamentals/) pages.
